## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

  - Clicking on an item in the dashboard list navigates to a detail view for that item
  - Detail view includes extra information about the item not included in the dashboard view
  - The same sidebar is displayed in detail view as in dashboard view
  - *To ensure an accurate grade, your sidebar **must** be viewable when showing the details view in your recording.*
- [X] **Each detail view of an item has a direct, unique URL link to that item’s detail view page**
  -  *To ensure an accurate grade, the URL/address bar of your web browser **must** be viewable in your recording.*
- [X] **The app includes at least two unique charts developed using the fetched data that tell an interesting story**
  - At least two charts should be incorporated into the dashboard view of the site

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The graph part is impossible to do without AI or outside help. I did struggle a bit with the <Routes> as well, but I got it done. And another skill to the bag.
